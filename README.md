# Online Classroom

This project is intended to be an online classroom that students can use for quizzes and tests. I expect functionality
to grow from there.

## TODO list

Add the ability to open and close courses from student view.
Filtering various views, especially the questions and assessments.
Add other question types.
Bring in auto-grading capbilities. (Look into how to do sbt on Heroku, but potentially plan to move this to campus.)
