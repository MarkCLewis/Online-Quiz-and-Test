# Online Classroom

This project is intended to be an online classroom that students can use for quizzes and tests. I expect functionality
to grow from there.

## TODO list

- Add a remove option for assessments in a course. In theory this should only work for assessments that haven't been taken yet.
- Change selects that add on change to have a button that adds. Prevents issue where filter and selection interact.
- Add grade displays to student course page.
- Verify that manual entry grades are present.
- Add Parson's problems.
- Add fill in the blank problems. Use Regex for correct answers.
